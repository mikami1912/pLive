         As long as the app still running in the background (update user location --> save to DB). User always BE requested to stream data (through Push Notification), coz core value of pLive is stream LIVED video at LOCATION, which mean this location need someone ready to stream. if pLive can't record user location data --> no need to ask user to stream coz we dont' know where they are so they can't ready to stream.
         
         Need to make some BUTTON in UI to do something like TERMINATE absolutely (same function as manually terminate by user action (double click home button and swipe unused app) in device) and stop record userLocation. This button (or manualy remove app by double click Home button and remove) need to implement:
         - stop record userLocation Data
         - remove userLocation Data out of placeLocation DB Node coz we don't know how user move after stop and not gurantee user still there . So if we request user (after terminate app) in placeLocation table, there is high potential we get wrong data.
